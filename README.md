# Simple-Car-Detection-and-Tracking-Distance-Between-Cars-with-Background-Subtraction-Using-OpenCV
This code captures video, detects cars using background subtraction, and tracks their movement with basic centroid tracking. It draws bounding rectangles around detected cars and lines indicating movement. Adjustments may be needed for different scenarios or more complex tracking requirements.
